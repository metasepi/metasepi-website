We had "Metasepi team meeting #10" at
[Programming Symposium #55](http://www.ipsj.or.jp/prosym/55/55CFA.html).

In the past, we have promoted Metasepi for software developers.
However, not for software researchers.
Then, I tried to join Programming Symposium for it.

I wrote a paper with only 2 pages.
This paper is reviewed by [\@mzp](https://twitter.com/mzp) with meticulous
care.
Thank's a lot, mzp!
