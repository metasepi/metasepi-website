Welcome back, all! Um? Do you forget me?

If you read this blog, I think you have read [Haskell Advent Calendar
2011:「簡約!?
λカ娘(二期)」とHaskell製OSの紹介](http://d.masterq.net/?date=20111221#p01). I
introduced Haskell OS named [House](http://programatica.cs.pdx.edu/House/)
on the article. However the House stops growing and [Light
House](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~kennyg/house/) website is down. I think they
are dead...

While set reading House source code aside for another day, the fact means
"Strong typed language such like Haskell or OCaml can't design practical
real kernel?" No! I believe it's caused by less guts. Nobody have guts to
keep developing the projects to start
[dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food).

Then, give the name \"Metasepi\" a project creating practical real kernel
using strong typed language. The good name sounds like sea.

I'll write code soon, while the blog says absurd idea today.
