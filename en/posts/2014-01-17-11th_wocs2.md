We had "Metasepi team meeting #11" at
["11th Workshop of Critical Software
Systems(11thWOCS2)"](http://stage.tksc.jaxa.jp/jedi/en/event/20140115.html).

At Metasepi team meeting #10, we promoted Metasepi for university
researcher.
This time, I would like to promote it for corporate researcher.
However, people at this workshop mainly discuss pure software-design
process,
and nobody discuss programming language as us.
I think they need method that is ready-to-use on their job site.

But there is also a problem that is solved by us.
Because we have only chosen "C language + design method to support the
language"
as facile solution in the past, software engineer is luckless today.
To fix it, we should choose some fitting languages to be good for system
programming,
as chose C language instead of assembler
Also Metasepi project should produce some practical technologies for some
real domains,
as soon as possible.
"It can run on MCU" still isn't enough to do it.

By the way, many corporate researchers associate
[Ada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)) with
"strongly typed language".
I know we should clearly explain difference between "type " of languages
having type inference and of such like Ada.
