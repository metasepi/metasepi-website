## January, 2015

I start to write textbook of ATS language named ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).
Writing the document stopped at September, 2015. Please keep going me...

I introduced ATS language in Japanese local academic meeting ["PPL 2015"](http://www-kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ppl2015/).

_list of the things done_

* Made a presentation ["ATS Programming Tutorial"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-tutorial).

_list of the things done_

* Re-write examples of [Book "Getting Started with Arduino"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155520.do) using ATS language. ([arduino-ats](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ats))

## May, 2015

_list of the things done_

* Wrote a paper ["Arduino programing of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.metasepi.org/doc/metasepi-icfp2015-arduino-ats.pdf) reviewd by Hongwei.

## September, 2015

This month, I published most valued presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users),
that introduces proof in ATS language with examples. I needed half year to understand it, deeply.

## November, 2015

This month, I published valued presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language),
that explain statics in ATS with example of rock-paper-scissors library. Using the presentation, I can understand dynamics/statics/proofs clearly.

* Made a presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language).
* Made a presentation ["ATS language overview'"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-language-overview-54844736).
* Made a presentation ["ATS programming on ESP8266"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-on-esp8266).

## What's coming next in 2016?

Today, I'm having following to-do list:

* Trying to create new language, that is similar to ATS and has more rich statics like Alloy.
* [VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast).
* Compare ATS with Rust.
* Compare ATS statics with Alloy.
