This year is learning deeply ATS proof for me. Unfortunately, I can't create any products for Metasepi project, however the learning was very fun.
Let's look back on 2015, and dream next year!

## January, 2015

I start to write textbook of ATS language named ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).
Writing the document stopped at September, 2015. Please keep going me...

_list of the things done_

* Started to write ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).

## February, 2015

Nothing.

## March, 2015

I introduced ATS language in Japanese local academic meeting ["PPL 2015"](http://www-kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ppl2015/).

_list of the things done_

* Made a presentation ["ATS Programming Tutorial"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-tutorial).

## April, 2015

I translated examples of [Book "Getting Started with Arduino"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155520.do) into ATS lanugage.
The project is [arduino-ats](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ats) and seed for paper ["Arduino programing of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.metasepi.org/doc/metasepi-icfp2015-arduino-ats.pdf).

_list of the things done_

* Re-write examples of [Book "Getting Started with Arduino"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155520.do) using ATS language.

## May, 2015

I tried to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language on [mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/) platform. It needed many "unsafe" keyword and didn't have well-established method to build binary without run-time.
Then, I stopped to use Rust in embedded system, more.

And I tried to translate ["Software Foundations Prop_J: Propositions and Evidence"](http://proofcafe.org/sf-beta/Prop_J.html) into ATS.
It was good idea to compare ATS with the other languages such like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/).
Also I believe that comparing view of ATS with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) or doing statics of it with [Alloy](http://alloy.mit.edu/alloy/) will be useful to understand ATS.

_list of the things done_

* Started ["Introduction to Programming in ATS" reading club](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/24141).
* Translated ["Software Foundations Prop_J: Propositions and Evidence"](http://proofcafe.org/sf-beta/Prop_J.html) into ATS.
* Wrote a paper ["Arduino programing of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.metasepi.org/doc/metasepi-icfp2015-arduino-ats.pdf) reviewd by Hongwei.
* Made a presentation ["Embedded Rust and more"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/embedded-rust-and-more).

## June, 2015

I created [palindrome library in ATS](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/tree/master/atslf_palindrome) to understand proofs of ATS.
It became seed for presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users).

_list of the things done_

* Created [palindrome library in ATS](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/tree/master/atslf_palindrome).
* Tried to manage multiple-pointer in ATS.

## July, 2015

This month, I had an idea to [create merge sort using proof and linear type](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/blob/master/gfarray_mergesort/main.dats).
The idea's base is that "in-place merge sort" can be shaped using some proof and linear type.
Why need such library? The purpose was to get proof of concept for proof driven development on Arduino Uno platform can't use any malloc.
But the implementation is very complex, and can't be managed by me...
Next time, I should take an approach what primary create code with linear type without proof, and secondary re-fine the code with proof.

And these days, I suspected that applying proof to big software architecture is impossible. I think ATS language needs better proof engine at least.
Is it the [patsolve](http://www.illtyped.com/projects/patsolve/) using [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)? Or ATS needs tactic like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)?

An example proof for big software architecture is [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/) what should be surveyed next year.

_list of the things done_

* Start to [create merge sort using proof and linear type](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/blob/master/gfarray_mergesort/main.dats). But it has not been implemented yet.

## August, 2015

Fortunately, I had chance to [visit Hongwei's research room](http://togetter.com/li/867083).
The local meeting is exciting for me!

_list of the things done_

* [Visited Hongwei's research room](http://togetter.com/li/867083).
* Published [Functional Ikamusume 8](http://www.paraiso-lang.org/ikmsm/books/c88.html).

## September, 2015

This month, I published most valued presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users),
that introduces proof in ATS language with examples. I needed half year to understand it deeply.

_list of the things done_

* Mike Jones joined ATS mailing list. He showed [Pros/Cons for ATS](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ats-lang-users/mhBjJ4D8Vaw/JhikbQsaDwAJ) what is useful for beginner.
* Made a presentation ["Arduino programming of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/arduino-programming-of-mlstyle-in-ats).
* Made a presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users).
* Made a presentation ["ATS language overview"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-language-overview).

## October, 2015

Nothing.

## November, 2015

This month, I published valued presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language),
that explain statics in ATS with example of rock-paper-scissors library. Using the presentation, I can understand dynamics/statics/proofs clearly.

[ATS programming on ESP8266](https://github.com/fpiot/esp8266-ats) was started. I would like to create a good demo movie to tweet over Wi-Fi and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

_list of the things done_

* Tried to survey [eChronos OS](http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/echronos/). But the OS is [in developing stage](https://github.com/echronos/echronos/issues/13). The [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/) is better to be surveyed.
* Finished ["Introduction to Programming in ATS" reading club](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34080).
* Made a presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language).
* Made a presentation ["ATS language overview'"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-language-overview-54844736).
* Made a presentation ["ATS programming on ESP8266"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-on-esp8266).

## December, 2015

I tried to survey [Smart.js](https://smartjs.io/).
I believe that using JavaScript on MCU doesn't make sense, however [Cesanta's middleware](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/smartjs-javascript-engine-running-on-tiny-mcu/9) has good quality.
The middleware will be useful on [Functionl IoT projects](http://fpiot.metasepi.org/).

I found [VeriFast](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/) verifier what puts precondition and postcondition in comment of C language.
I believe it can also do Programming with Theorem-Proving, such like ATS.
[VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast) was started.
Today, the demo code [only verifies parameters](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast/blob/master/_arduino4verifast/Arduino.h), but I'll try to apply more proof.
Big negative aspect of VeriFast is that it's not open source project.

_list of the things done_

* Tried [Ivory programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ivory). I think Ivory is a well-typed language what can't create NULL pointer.
* Start to do [VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast).
* Made a presentation ["Smart.js: JavaScript engine running on tiny MCU"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/smartjs-javascript-engine-running-on-tiny-mcu).

## What's coming next in 2016?

Today, I'm having following to-do list:

* Monthly organize [Functional IoT meetup](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34203) what widely covers formal methods of embedded system.
* [VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast).
* Survey [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/).
* Finish to write ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).
* Compare ATS with Rust.
* Compare ATS statics with Alloy.
* Trying to create new language, that is similar to ATS and has more rich statics like Alloy.
* Hardware software co-design using strong type on [Mico8](http://www.latticesemi.com/Products/DesignSoftwareAndIP/IntellectualProperty/IPCore/IPCores02/Mico8.aspx).
* Support DWARF in ATS to debug binary using gdb.
* Survey Higher-Order Model Checking.
* Implement queue theory in Unix-like kernel.
* Come back NetBSD kernel to rewrite big part such like TCP/IP stack.
* Create strongly typed RTOS such like [chopstx](http://git.gniibe.org/gitweb/?p=chopstx/chopstx.git;a=summary).
* IDE for ATS.
* Better error messages of ATS.
* Make money.

Primary challenge will be hosting [Functional IoT meetup](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34203) monthly.
Today, we don't have documents what widely covers formal methods of embedded system. We are not researcher, and engineer.
We would like to get soundness and safety for production, and have no time to shape these.
I think trade show is needed to get the documents.
How about collect up a [chart what has vertical axis of software stack and horizontal axis of hardware platform](https://github.com/fpiot),
while create many projects such like [ATS programing on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ats)?
For example, ATS and Ivory can be used on 8-bit/16-bit/32-bit hardware platform, however [jhc](http://repetae.net/computer/jhc/) is only for 32-bit hardware.
The other to-do should be managed under the meetup.

Secondary, I would like to get environment on that all people easily program LED blinking using functional language on tiny MCU such like Cortex-M series and 8-bit Arduino.
We should support [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/) and [ESP8266](http://espressif.com/en/products/wroom/) as the hardware platform.

To find not-understanding methods such like seL4/VeriFast in the early stages is good idea.
["Related Languages" on Whiley](http://whiley.org/) is useful for it.

May the new year bring us happiness!
