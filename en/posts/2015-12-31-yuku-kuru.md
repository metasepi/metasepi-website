## January, 2015

I start to write textbook of ATS language named ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).
Writing the document stopped at September, 2015. Please keep going me...

_list of the things done_

* Started to write ["ATS Programming Foundations"](http://jats-ug.metasepi.org/doc/ATS2/ATS_Foundations/).

## February, 2015

_list of the things done_

## March, 2015

I introduced ATS language in Japanese local academic meeting ["PPL 2015"](http://www-kb.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ppl2015/).

_list of the things done_

* Made a presentation ["ATS Programming Tutorial"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-tutorial).

## April, 2015

_list of the things done_

* Re-write examples of [Book "Getting Started with Arduino"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596155520.do) using ATS language. ([arduino-ats](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ats))

## May, 2015

I tried to use [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) language on [mbed](https://www.mbed.com/en/) platform. It needed many "unsafe" keyword and didn't have well-established method to build binary without run-time.
Then, I stopped to use Rust in embedded system, more.

_list of the things done_

* Started ["Introduction to Programming in ATS" reading club](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/24141).
* Translated ["Software Foundations Prop_J: Propositions and Evidence"](http://proofcafe.org/sf-beta/Prop_J.html) into ATS.
* Wrote a paper ["Arduino programing of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.metasepi.org/doc/metasepi-icfp2015-arduino-ats.pdf) reviewd by Hongwei.
* Made a presentation ["Embedded Rust and more"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/embedded-rust-and-more).

## June, 2015

_list of the things done_

* Created [palindrome library in ATS](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/tree/master/atslf_palindrome).
* Tried to manage multiple-pointer in ATS.

## July, 2015

This month, I had an idea to [create merge sort using proof and linear type](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/blob/master/gfarray_mergesort/main.dats).
The idea's base is that "in-place merge sort" can be shaped using some proof and linear type.
Why need such library? The purpose is to get proof of concept for proof driven development on Arduino Uno platform can't use malloc.
But the implementation is very complex, and can't be managed by me...
Next time, I should take an approach what primary create code with linear type without proof, and secondary re-fine the code with proof.

And these days, I suspected that applying proof to big software architecture is impossible. I think ATS language needs more better proof engine at least.
Is it the [patsolve](http://www.illtyped.com/projects/patsolve/) using [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)? Or ATS needs tactic like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)?

An example proof for big software architecture is [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/) what should be surveyed next year.

_list of the things done_

* Start to [create merge sort using proof and linear type](https://github.com/jats-ug/practice-ats/blob/master/gfarray_mergesort/main.dats). But it has not been implemented yet.

## August, 2015

_list of the things done_

* Published [Functional Ikamusume 8](http://www.paraiso-lang.org/ikmsm/books/c88.html).

## September, 2015

This month, I published most valued presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users),
that introduces proof in ATS language with examples. I needed half year to understand it, deeply.

_list of the things done_

* Mike Jones joined ATS mailing list. He showed [Pros/Cons for ATS](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ats-lang-users/mhBjJ4D8Vaw/JhikbQsaDwAJ) what is useful for beginner.
* Made a presentation ["Arduino programming of ML-style in ATS"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/arduino-programming-of-mlstyle-in-ats).
* Made a presentation ["ATS/LF for Coq users"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/atslf-for-coq-users).
* Made a presentation ["ATS language overview"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-language-overview).

## October, 2015

_list of the things done_

## November, 2015

This month, I published valued presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language),
that explain statics in ATS with example of rock-paper-scissors library. Using the presentation, I can understand dynamics/statics/proofs clearly.

[ATS programming on ESP8266](https://github.com/fpiot/esp8266-ats) was started. I would like to create a good demo movie to tweet over Wi-Fi and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/).

_list of the things done_

* Tried to survey [eChronos OS](http://ssrg.nicta.com.au/projects/TS/echronos/). But the OS is [in developing stage](https://github.com/echronos/echronos/issues/13). The [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/) is better to be surveyed.
* Finished ["Introduction to Programming in ATS" reading club](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34080).
* Made a presentation ["Static typing and proof in ATS language"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/static-typing-and-proof-on-ats-language).
* Made a presentation ["ATS language overview'"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-language-overview-54844736).
* Made a presentation ["ATS programming on ESP8266"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/ats-programming-on-esp8266).

## December, 2015

I tried to survey [Smart.js](https://smartjs.io/).
I believe that using JavaScript on MCU doesn't make sense, however [Cesanta's middleware](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/smartjs-javascript-engine-running-on-tiny-mcu/9) has good quality.
The middleware will be useful on [Functionl IoT projects](http://fpiot.metasepi.org/).

I found [VeriFast](http://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~bart.jacobs/verifast/) verifier what puts precondition and postcondition in comment of C language.
I believe it can also do Programming with Theorem-Proving, such like ATS.
[VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast) was started.
Today, the demo code [only verifies parameters](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast/blob/master/_arduino4verifast/Arduino.h), but I'll try to apply more proof.
Big negative aspect of VeriFast is that it's not open source project.

_list of the things done_

* Tried [Ivory programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ivory). I think Ivory is a well-typed language what can't create NULL pointer.
* Start to do [VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast).
* Made a presentation ["Smart.js: JavaScript engine running on tiny MCU"](http://www.slideshare.net/master_q/smartjs-javascript-engine-running-on-tiny-mcu).

## What's coming next in 2016?

Today, I'm having following to-do list:

* Monthly organize [Functional IoT meetup](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34203) what widely covers formal methods of embedded system.
* [VeriFast programming on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-verifast).
* Survey [seL4 OS](http://sel4.systems/).
* Compare ATS with Rust.
* Compare ATS statics with Alloy.
* Trying to create new language, that is similar to ATS and has more rich statics like Alloy.

Primary challenge will be hosting [Functional IoT meetup](https://fpiot.doorkeeper.jp/events/34203) monthly.
Today, we don't have documents what widely covers formal methods of embedded system. We are not researcher, and engineer.
We would like to get soundness and safety for production, and have no time to shape these.
I think trade show is needed to get the documents.
How about collect up a [chart what has vertical axis of software stack and horizontal axis of hardware platform](https://github.com/fpiot),
while create many projects such like [ATS programing on Arduino](https://github.com/fpiot/arduino-ats)?

The other to-do is managed under the meetup.
